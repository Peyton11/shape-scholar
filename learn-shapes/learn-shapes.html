    <div id="shape-list-container">
        <ul id="shape-list">
            <li><strong>Cube- </strong>A three-dimensional shape with six equal square faces, twelve edges, and eight vertices. It's a type of rectangular prism where all sides are equal.</li>
            <li><strong>Sphere- </strong>A perfectly round 3D object, like a ball, with every point on its surface equidistant from its center. It has no edges or vertices.</li>
            <li><strong>Cylinder- </strong>A solid with two parallel circular bases connected by a curved surface at a fixed distance from the center of the circles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cone- </strong>A shape with a circular base that tapers smoothly to a single point called the apex.</li>
            <li><strong>Pyramid- </strong>A polyhedron with a polygon base and triangular faces that meet at a single point, called the apex.</li>
            <li><strong>Triangular Prism- </strong>A prism with triangular bases and three rectangular faces connecting the corresponding sides of the triangles.</li>
            <li><strong>Rectangular Prism- </strong>A prism with six rectangular faces, twelve edges, and eight vertices, with opposite faces being equal and parallel.</li>
            <li><strong>Pentagonal Prism- </strong>A prism with two pentagonal bases and five rectangular sides connecting the bases.</li>
            <li><strong>Hexagonal Prism- </strong>A prism with two hexagonal bases and six rectangular sides connecting the bases.</li>
            <li><strong>Heptagonal Prism- </strong>A prism with two heptagonal bases (seven-sided polygons) and seven rectangular sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Octagonal Prism- </strong>A prism with two octagonal bases (eight-sided polygons) and eight rectangular sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Nonagonal Prism- </strong>A prism with two nonagonal bases (nine-sided polygons) and nine rectangular sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Ellipsoid- </strong>A 3D shape resembling a stretched sphere, where the radii along three perpendicular axes can differ.</li>
            <li><strong>Torus- </strong>A donut-shaped 3D object formed by revolving a circle around an axis outside of itself.</li>
            <li><strong>Octahedron- </strong>A polyhedron with eight equilateral triangular faces, twelve edges, and six vertices.</li>
            <li><strong>Tetrahedron </strong>A polyhedron with four triangular faces, six edges, and four vertices. It's the simplest form of a pyramid.</li>
            <li><strong>Dodecahedron- </strong>A polyhedron with twelve pentagonal faces, twenty vertices, and thirty edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Icosahedron- </strong>A polyhedron with twenty equilateral triangular faces, twelve vertices, and thirty edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Frustrum- </strong>A truncated cone or pyramid, formed by cutting the shape parallel to its base and removing the top portion.</li>
            <li><strong>Hexagonal Antiprism- </strong>A polyhedron with two parallel hexagonal bases connected by an alternating band of triangular faces.</li>
            <li><strong>Star- </strong>A star-shaped 3D object often represented as a stellated polyhedron, formed by extending the faces or edges of a simpler polyhedron.</li>
            <li><strong>Heart- </strong>A heart-shaped 3D object typically created by combining curves like circles and parabolas.</li>
        </ul>
